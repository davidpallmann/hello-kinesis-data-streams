# Hello, Kinesis Data Streams!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Kinesis Data Streams!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-kinesis-data-streams) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Kinesis Data Streamsa. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to produce and consume a data stream. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.6.

## Our Hello, Kinesis Data Streams Project

We will first create a Kinesis Data Stream in the AWS management console. Then, you'll create a .NET producer program and .NET consumer program. 

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
